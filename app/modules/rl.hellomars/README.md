# Project Modules
This is my project modules.  All the stuff directly related to my project goes in here.

## initialize/
These files do setup tasks for my project.

* Pull in vendor modules
* Configure vendor modules
* Configure my app
* Define my default route

## layout/
This is the equivalent of `index.html` for my project.
I'll place my header, footer, and other common elements and controls here.
Other pages in my project will be loaded as a sub-route of a layout.  (You can have as many layouts
as you want.)

## sayhello/
This is the first functional area in my project.  It's a page that shows off various 'hello world'
functionality.
